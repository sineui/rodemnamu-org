              <p>Rodemnamu Church is a church that raises 'disciples who make disciples.' To this end, we 'go' to college students, international students, the younger generation, and adults, 'baptize' those who receive the Gospel, and 'teach them to obey' everything Jesus Christ commanded. Following the Great Commission, we raise mature disciples who resemble Jesus.</p>

              <p>Rodemnamu Church is a 'dynamic,' 'missional church.' We believe that mission is life itself and that our everyday lives are the starting point of mission. Before being a church that does mission, we aspire to be a missional presence. Furthermore, we aspire to be a missional church that shares the Lord's Gospel beyond our homes, church, workplace, and every sphere — across a unified Korea and to the ends of the earth.</p>

              <p>Rodemnamu Church seeks to continue the legacy of the historic Reformed church that aimed to return to the early church through the Reformation. Learning from the Antioch church in Scripture (Acts 11-13) and Calvin's 16th-century Geneva church, we pray to be built as a church rooted in God's Word in our present city and context — where Christ is the head and ruler, where we worship and learn from the Lord, and where we transform the world through the Gospel and carry out mission.</p>

            <h4 class="staff-card__bio-title">About the Senior Pastor</h4>
            <p class="staff-card__bio">Rev. Byeong-yong Yoo was born again as a child of God during his college years through the grace of God and the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit, by faith in the Gospel of the cross of Jesus Christ. During college, he enjoyed a blessed time of walking with God, discovering the joy of knowing Him, and forming a biblical Christian worldview.</p>
            <p class="staff-card__bio">After graduation, with the heart of one indebted to the Gospel, he was called to serve as a staff worker with a campus mission organization. He learned to shepherd individual souls with the heart of Jesus as a father, and to serve a biblical and balanced community of the Lord. Through his M.Div. studies, he examined his experiences and convictions against Reformed theology, training in what it means to build and serve the body of Christ's church today based on historic Reformed theology.</p>
            <p class="staff-card__bio">Feeling the need for deeper theological study while serving as an associate pastor, he entered the Th.M. program in Historical Theology to study the 16th-century Reformer John Calvin. This helped him further refine his direction toward holistic and balanced pastoral ministry rooted in historic Reformed theology. Since 2011, he has been called to serve as the second senior pastor of Rodemnamu Church.</p>
            <p class="staff-card__bio">To establish a holistic pastoral theology grounded in Reformed theology, he entered the doctoral program to conduct comparative research on John Calvin and Abraham Kuyper, the Dutch Reformed theologian and practitioner. Today, he continues to serve the church joyfully alongside the members of Rodemnamu Church, with a dream for the Kingdom of God and a desire to build a church that pleases the Lord.</p>
